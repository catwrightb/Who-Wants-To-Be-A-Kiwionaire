# Who-Wants-To-Be-A-Kiwionaire

Who wants to be a Kiwionaire is a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" style game created for AUT paper Programing Design and Construction COMP603.

The game was a group project with two parts to the project 1) to create the game in a console format 2) then convert the game to a GUI.

This repository only includes the final GUI game.

The game runs just like the "Who wants to be a millionaire" game with player progressing through game rounds answers random questions, which are stored using a embedded Derby Database. Questions answers are also randomized, so no memorizing answers ;). Players also have three life lines which they are able to use at any point of the game, be careful though as your friend and audience might not always know the correct answer. On winning the game player are given the opportunity to submit their own question which will be stored in the games database and used for future games. Top players scores and username are also proudly displayed on a scoreboard from the main menu. Best of all player will have lovely images of some of NZ best spots to enjoy as they spend countless hours playing.
